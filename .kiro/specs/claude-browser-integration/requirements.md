# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates browser-use with Claude AI and browserless to create a seamless browser automation experience within the frontend UI. The system enables Claude to intelligently call browser-use endpoints as native tool calls, activating a browser agent that displays live browser sessions embedded in the UI. The integration includes multi-tab workflow monitoring, human-in-the-loop control mechanisms, MCP integration with Gmail and Google Calendar, and voice agent capabilities via Telnyx/Vapi.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want Claude to intelligently call browser-use endpoints as native tool calls, so that browser automation tasks are seamlessly initiated through natural language commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a prompt that requires browser automation THEN Claude SHALL identify the need for browser interaction and make a native tool call to the browser-use endpoint
2. WHEN Claude makes a browser-use tool call THEN the system SHALL activate the browser agent with the appropriate prompt
3. WHEN the browser agent is activated THEN the system SHALL maintain context between Claude and the browser agent
4. IF Claude determines a task requires browser automation THEN the system SHALL automatically route the request without requiring explicit browser commands from the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a live browser window embedded within the UI when the browser agent is activated, so that I can visually monitor the automation process in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser agent receives a prompt THEN the browser viewing panel SHALL automatically open in the UI
2. WHEN the browser viewing panel opens THEN a live browser window SHALL be embedded using browserless and RealURL integration
3. WHEN the browser session is active THEN the embedded browser SHALL display real-time updates of all browser actions
4. WHEN the browser agent performs actions THEN the user SHALL see visual feedback of each action in the embedded browser
5. IF the browser session encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages in the UI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want multi-tab workflows to be seamlessly monitored, so that I can track browser automation across multiple browser tabs simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser agent opens multiple tabs THEN the system SHALL monitor all active tabs
2. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the UI SHALL reflect the currently active tab in the embedded browser view
3. WHEN actions occur in background tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain awareness of all tab states
4. WHEN multiple tabs are active THEN the user SHALL be able to see a visual indicator of all open tabs
5. IF tab management is required THEN the system SHALL provide controls for tab navigation within the UI

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to take control from the agent at any time and relinquish it back, so that I can intervene when necessary and guide the automation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests control THEN the system SHALL immediately pause the agent and transfer control to the user
2. WHEN the user has control THEN they SHALL be able to interact directly with the embedded browser
3. WHEN the user is ready to return control THEN they SHALL be able to reactivate the agent with a single action
4. WHEN control is transferred back to the agent THEN the system SHALL provide context about the current browser state
5. IF the user takes control during an active task THEN the agent SHALL pause and wait for user input

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to request human intervention when it detects it's stuck, so that I can troubleshoot issues and help the agent continue successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent detects it is stuck or unable to proceed THEN it SHALL automatically request human intervention
2. WHEN human intervention is requested THEN the system SHALL display a clear notification to the user
3. WHEN the user provides troubleshooting assistance THEN they SHALL be able to guide the agent with contextual prompts
4. WHEN troubleshooting is complete THEN the user SHALL be able to provide grounding prompts to help ensure desired output
5. IF the agent encounters repeated failures THEN it SHALL escalate to human intervention automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the browser-use agent to have MCP integration with Gmail and Google Calendar, so that I can automate email and calendar tasks through browser automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent needs to access Gmail THEN it SHALL use MCP integration to authenticate and interact with Gmail services
2. WHEN the agent needs to access Google Calendar THEN it SHALL use MCP integration to read and modify calendar events
3. WHEN MCP tools are called THEN the system SHALL handle authentication and authorization seamlessly
4. WHEN Gmail or Calendar actions are performed THEN the results SHALL be reflected in both the browser view and the MCP responses
5. IF MCP authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice agent capabilities with telephone abilities via Telnyx/Vapi, so that I can interact with the browser automation system through voice commands and receive audio feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice input is provided THEN the system SHALL process it through Telnyx/Vapi integration
2. WHEN voice commands are recognized THEN they SHALL be converted to appropriate browser automation tasks
3. WHEN the agent performs actions THEN it SHALL provide audio feedback through the voice system
4. WHEN telephone capabilities are needed THEN the system SHALL use Telnyx for phone-based interactions
5. IF voice recognition fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback text-based interaction options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration to be robust and handle errors gracefully, so that the system remains stable during complex browser automation tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser-use encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN browserless connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN Claude tool calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user
4. WHEN the embedded browser becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL detect and recover automatically
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain user session state and allow graceful recovery

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the browser automation to maintain context and state across sessions, so that I can resume complex tasks without losing progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a browser session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain session state including cookies and local storage
2. WHEN the user navigates away and returns THEN the browser state SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN tasks span multiple interactions THEN the agent SHALL maintain context of previous actions
4. WHEN sessions are restored THEN all browser tabs and their states SHALL be recovered
5. IF session restoration fails THEN the system SHALL provide options to restart with preserved context
