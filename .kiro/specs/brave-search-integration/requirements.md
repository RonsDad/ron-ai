# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate the comprehensive Brave Search API as a native tool call that AI models can use directly within the browser-use framework. The integration will provide AI agents with access to web search, news search, image search, video search, local search, AI-powered summarization, and chat completions capabilities without needing to navigate to search engines manually through browser automation. This will significantly improve efficiency and reduce the overhead of browser-based searches while maintaining the stealth and anti-detection capabilities of the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to perform comprehensive web searches using the Brave Search API, so that I can quickly retrieve relevant information with rich metadata and structured results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI agent needs to search for information THEN the system SHALL provide native tool calls for all Brave Search API endpoints
2. WHEN the web search tool is called THEN the system SHALL return structured results including titles, URLs, descriptions, thumbnails, ratings, and metadata
3. WHEN search results include rich data THEN the system SHALL provide infoboxes, FAQ sections, discussions, and mixed response rankings
4. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with detailed error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to access specialized search types (news, images, videos, local), so that I can gather comprehensive and contextually relevant information for different tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a news search THEN the system SHALL return news articles with publication dates, sources, breaking news indicators, and extra snippets
2. WHEN performing an image search THEN the system SHALL return image URLs, thumbnails, dimensions, alt text, and source page information with proper error handling for missing images
3. WHEN performing a video search THEN the system SHALL return video metadata including duration, views, creator, publisher, and thumbnail information
4. WHEN performing a local search THEN the system SHALL return location results with coordinates, addresses, opening hours, ratings, and contact information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to use Brave's AI-powered summarization and chat capabilities, so that I can get direct answers and summaries without processing raw search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting a summary THEN the system SHALL use the summarizer endpoint to provide AI-generated summaries of search results
2. WHEN using chat completions THEN the system SHALL support the OpenAI-compatible endpoint for direct question answering
3. WHEN summarization is requested THEN the system SHALL handle the two-step process of web search followed by summary generation
4. WHEN chat streaming is needed THEN the system SHALL support both streaming and blocking modes for chat completions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure comprehensive Brave Search API settings and credentials, so that I can customize search behavior for different use cases and regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the integration THEN the system SHALL support API key configuration through environment variables (BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY)
2. WHEN configuring search parameters THEN the system SHALL support all query parameters including country, language, UI language, safe search, freshness, and result filtering
3. WHEN using advanced features THEN the system SHALL support Goggles for custom re-ranking, extra snippets, and location-based headers
4. WHEN no API key is provided THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to browser-based search as fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor API usage and handle rate limits, so that I can manage costs and ensure reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track usage statistics, response times, and rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*)
2. WHEN rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent throttling based on remaining quota
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide appropriate backoff strategies
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging of requests, responses, and API version information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want intelligent caching and result optimization, so that I can avoid redundant API calls and get the best quality results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identical search queries are made THEN the system SHALL return cached results within a configurable time window
2. WHEN cache control is needed THEN the system SHALL support no-cache headers for real-time results
3. WHEN image results are processed THEN the system SHALL validate image availability and dimensions before returning results
4. WHEN local search results are needed THEN the system SHALL support batch retrieval of location details and AI-generated descriptions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with existing browser automation workflows, so that I can combine search results with browser actions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results contain URLs THEN the system SHALL allow direct navigation to those URLs in the browser session
2. WHEN combining search with browser actions THEN the system SHALL maintain session state and context across operations
3. WHEN search results need verification THEN the system SHALL support opening multiple result URLs in tabs with proper session management
4. WHEN integrating with existing workflows THEN the system SHALL be compatible with current agent prompts and system architecture

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to handle complex search scenarios and result types, so that I can process diverse content types and structured data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results contain structured data THEN the system SHALL parse and provide schema.org markup, recipes, products, and reviews
2. WHEN location-sensitive queries are made THEN the system SHALL automatically include location context and provide relevant local results
3. WHEN search results include multimedia content THEN the system SHALL provide proper metadata for videos, images, and audio content
4. WHEN search queries require spell correction THEN the system SHALL provide both original and corrected query results with clear indication of modifications
